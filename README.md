# freeipa-check-container-side

Proof of concept to verify the impact of changes in [freeipa](https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa)
repository by trying to build the container images injecting the RPM
repository generated by the PR at freeipa repository.

## Usage

1. Grab the hash associated to your Pull Request at [freeipa](https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa).

1. Run the checker script by:

   ```shell
   S3_HASH="<the-hash-grabbed-from-the-pull-request>" ./check-container-build.sh
   ```

The logs are stored in `logs` directory, so they can be analyzed when the container builds fail.
